# Mosquitoes-modelling-

## What's this about?

We are trying to link up the phyisicochemical properties of larval habitats to explain for mosquito species abundance and co-occupancy. 
We had about 20 physicochemical parameters to play with. so, we rather performed some dimension reduction analysis and pick the most important components. The most important loadings are use used as predictors for a Generalized linear mixed effect models

Hey! You could check the codes yourself!
