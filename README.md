# Mosquitoes-modelling-

## What's this about?

I and Dr Omoregie are trying to link up the phyisicochemical properties of larval habitats to explain for mosquito species abundance and co-occupancy. 
We had about 20 physicochemical parameters to play with. so, we rather performed some dimension reduction analysis and pick the most important components. The most important loadings are use used as predictors for a Generalized linear mixed effect models

Hey! You could check the codes yourself!

**Project is still in progress.."

## How to use the repo

1. find the codes in the  **codes** folder
2. All dataset are available in the **data** folder
3. Notes-- you'd likewise find them in the **Notes** folder
